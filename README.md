## Overview

Welcome to **Warden**! This project is my personal exploration into the world of service meshes, inspired by Envoy and built using the Zig programming language. The primary goal is educational: to gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes, understand microservices networking, and explore the design and implementation challenges of a service mesh.

## Why Warden?

- **Educational Journey:** I’m building Warden to deepen my understanding of Kubernetes internals, traffic management, observability, chaos testing and the intricacies of service-to-service communication.
- **Zig Exploration:** Zig’s performance, safety, and simplicity make it an excellent candidate for building low-level, high-performance systems like a service mesh.
- **Inspired by Envoy:** While Envoy provides a rich set of features, Warden aims to implement core concepts in a more minimalist, experimental manner, shedding light on the underlying mechanics without the complexity of a full-fledged production system.

## What Warden Does

At its core, Warden is designed to:

- **Manage Traffic:** Route, load balance, and implement basic circuit breaking between services.
- **Enhance Observability:** Collect logs, metrics, and provide tracing hooks to monitor service interactions.
- **Enforce Security:** Facilitate secure communication (e.g., TLS) between microservices.
- **Integrate with Kubernetes:** Discover services and endpoints dynamically through the Kubernetes API.

## Roadmap

### **MVP**

- **Basic Traffic Routing:** Implement fundamental request routing between services.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests evenly across available service instances.
- **Logging & Metrics:** Integrate simple logging and metrics to monitor traffic and health.
- **Kubernetes Service Discovery:** Connect with the Kubernetes API to dynamically fetch service endpoints.

### **Next Steps**

- **mTLS Integration:** Secure service-to-service communication using mutual TLS.
- **Advanced Routing Policies:** Add features such as retries, timeouts, and basic circuit breaking.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Introduce hooks for tracing requests across services for better observability.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Enable hot-reloading and runtime configuration changes via Kubernetes CRDs or similar mechanisms.

### **Future Explorations**

- **Fault Injection & Testing:** Simulate failures to test resiliency.
- **Policy-Based Routing:** Experiment with routing based on custom policies and metadata.
- **Rate Limiting & Quotas:** Implement traffic control mechanisms to prevent service overload.
- **Edge Features:** Basic ingress/egress management (with a focus on simplicity and learning).


## What Warden Won't Be

For the purpose of maintaining focus and managing scope in this educational project, **Warden** will **not** implement:

- **Multi-Cluster Support:** This project is centered on single-cluster deployments for clarity and manageability.
- **Exhaustive Protocol Support:** Advanced protocol translations (e.g., legacy TCP proxies or bridging between diverse protocols) are out of scope.
- **Enterprise-Grade Features:** While some features may overlap with production service meshes, the goal here is learning and exploration rather than full enterprise readiness.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Zig Compiler](https://ziglang.org/)
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (local setups like [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) work well)
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and microservices concepts

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/warden.git
   cd warden
   ```
2. **Build Warden:**
   ```bash
   zig build
   ```
3. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
   - Follow the deployment instructions in the `deploy/` directory to integrate Warden with your Kubernetes cluster.


## Contributing

I welcome contributions, ideas, and feedback! If you’re interested in exploring the internals of service meshes or have suggestions for new features (or educational experiments), please open an issue or submit a pull request.


## License

Warden is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).


## Final Thoughts

Warden is both a learning tool and an experimental service mesh. While it won’t cover every feature found in production-ready systems, it serves as a playground for understanding the core principles of service communication, Kubernetes integration, and modern networking challenges.

Happy learning and exploring!
